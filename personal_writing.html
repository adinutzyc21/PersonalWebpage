    <h2><a href="personal.html">Personal</a> > Selected Writing</h2>
	For now, there is only one poem for this section. I have more poems, but most are in Romanian and would break the consistency of the site. I will update this with other writing if I get the chance.<br/><br/>
	I wrote this poem for a Virtual Poetry Slam in my last year of high school in the hope that I will get a scholarship. I didn't win, but I was one of the finalists!<br/>
    <div class="poem">
                  <p class="title">Injustice</p>
				  
                  We fight for rights: the right to speak, the right to learn, the right to choose;<br />
                  Each day we feel betrayed by others &#8212;<br />
                  We ask for social justice for ourselves, we never think of others.<br />
                  We do not care that we're denying them the basic rights we love so much...<br />
                  We think we're masters of the world: as such<br />
                  We do not give a damn on what they lose.<br />
                  <br />
                  'Bipeds in suits, that's what you are, it's all about what you achieve.<br />
                  Intelligence for you is finding ways to waste our futures fast;<br />
                  You kill, destroy, and do not care whether the Earth survives your generation;<br />
                  You steal our right to have our planet clean, that's what you are: you're thieves!<br />
                  You're calling yourself human? Well, we are humans too... We're just<br />
                  Humans today that have no suits: humans tomorrow without chance &#8212;<br />
                  We're praying for salvation...'<br />
                  <br />
                  'We are your children, we're children of the world, and children of this Earth,<br />
                  We seek the rights your generation is denying us from birth:<br />
                  The right to a clean Earth, no litter on the street,<br />
                  The right to a clean air, no matter where we breathe,<br />
                  The right to have green forests, the right to have a pet,<br />
                  Radiation-free homes, and... the right to get fat.'<br />
                  <br />
                  Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we'd better think of others,<br />
                  Should think about poor children, believe that they are ours!<br />
                  Be careful what we're doing, be selfless with the Earth,<br />
                  More resources we're wasting, their future's getting worse!<br />
                  More forests we are cutting, less oxygen emitted,<br />
                  More factories we're building, more cars we're using,<br />
                  Less air to breathe, and we all need it!<br />
                  More animals we're killing, less smiles on children's faces,<br />
                  Experiments with atoms mean cancer in most cases &#8212;<br />
                  More resources we waste, the more they're losing...<br />
                  <br />
                  All things we hurt? We drive them to their end,<br />
                  The things destroyed? We cannot mend...<br />
